# TODO
This is a list of feature I hope to add to MetaMaker

* add *--yes* argument to skip conversion prompts
* setup fail-safes if IMDb doesn't have info (refer to issue \#1)
* add *--remove-old* argument to delete mkv/avi after conversion (or do this by default and create a *--keep-old* argument)
* replace MP4Box (so that more tags ca be written)
