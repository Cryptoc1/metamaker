# MetaMaker
MetaMaker is a simple pyhton utility I created to write metadata to movie file (mp4, ~~m4v, mkv, avi, wmv~~).

## How To Use
Begin by running install.sh

	$ ./install.sh

Using MetaMaker is quite simple really:

	$ metamaker <imdb-id> <path-to-file>

Or, you can use the interactive console by running:

	$ metamaker


## Dependencies
* MP4Box

MP4Box can be installed with brew

	$ brew install mp4box
