# MetaMaker
MetaMaker is a simple pyhton utility I created to write metadata to movie file (mp4, m4v, mkv, avi, wmv).

## How To Use
Using MetaMaker is quite simple really:

		$ metamaker foo.mp4

You will then be prompted for the IMdB URL for the movie and the program will write the metadata for you.

## Dependencies
* MP4Box

MP4Box can be installed with brew
''' brew install mp4box
